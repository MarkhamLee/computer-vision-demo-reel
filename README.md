## Computer Vision Demo Reel
 Computer vision demos related to object detection, object segmentation and other types of visual AI for commercial and general industrial purposes.

I have a large number of demos, experiments, ideas and the like related to computer vision that exist along a continuum of barely started, to needing a bit of polish, to being finished but not large enough to be a stand-alone project, which just need to be put "somewhere". The purpose of this repo is to just aggregate all of those things into one place.

### People counting 
Tracking how many people are in a video, displaying the count of the video in the live video and also writing the data to InfluxDB for view in a Grafana dashboard. I.e., extend the typical people counting demo to include data logging and showing real stats in a dashboard.
